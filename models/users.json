    "shoutOut": "It's been great working with Ben the last few days. He approaches problems in a similar fashion to myself. When something doesn't work, continuously iterate until you find the solution. It isn't elegant but it gets the job done. I've enjoyed seeing his iteration practices though. He tends toward employing logic and tinkering slightly with the code whereas I quickly turn to Google / documentation / Stack for hints. I think we work pretty well together.",
